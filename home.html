                    Harder Era

                        <li>Players today are more skilled than when Jordan played</li>

                    Less Help
                    <ul>
                        <li>Jordan had hall of famer Scottie Pippen for each of his 6 championships</li>
                        <li>His team was able to build a better team because Jordan stayed with the Bulls most of his career</li>
                        <li>LeBron was forced to adapt to many different teams due to him changing teams frequently</li>
